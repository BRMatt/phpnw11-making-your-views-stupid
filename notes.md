# Making your views stupid

Hi! I'm Matt Button. I'm a core developer on the kohana framework project and
I'm studying computer Science at the University of York.

Today I'm going to be talking about making your views stupid, or rather

# Making your views stupidly simple

Simple code is good code.  it's easy to write, easy to debug and easy to maintain.

Unfortunately, PHP makes it easy for programmers to write lazy code, which is very easy
to write, but becomes a pain to maintain.

I'm sure most people have seen code like this at some point before:

# The PHP legacy

SQL injections, XSS injection, presentation logic mixed with business logic and so on.
